## Status Key



| Code | Meaning |

|------|---------|

| ✅ Built | Compiles on Linux as-is |

| ✅ Built (filtered) | Portable subset compiles; platform-specific sources classified and deferred |

| ❌ Blocked (SDK) | Missing third-party SDK (DirectX 8, Miles Sound System) |

| ❌ Blocked (header tangle) | Physical header path mixes game-logic types with SDK headers |

| ❌ Blocked (Win32) | Win32 APIs throughout (WCHAR, message loop, registry) |

| ❌ Deferred | Entire target is Win32/MFC/assembly; no portable subset exists |

| 🔶 Not modeled | CMakeLists.txt not yet created |

| ❌ N/A | Non-Windows only (COM/IDL ActiveX, assembly) |
